# Expo Prebuild Error: Unresolved Native Module

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error encountered when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command with custom native modules. The core issue lies in resolving native modules within the Expo build process, frequently resulting in vague error messages that hinder debugging.

## Problem Description

When integrating a custom native module into an Expo project, the `expo prebuild` step might fail due to an inability to locate or correctly link the native module.  The error messages are often cryptic, making it hard to identify the root cause. This could be due to issues with package versions, build configurations, or incorrect module paths.

## Solution

This repo offers a potential solution by illustrating best practices for integrating and configuring native modules in Expo. The key aspects to consider are:

* **Correct Module Setup:** Ensure that the native module's build process correctly integrates into the Expo environment.
* **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage dependencies to avoid version conflicts and ensure compatibility between the native module and other Expo packages.
* **Detailed Error Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to get clearer insights into the prebuild process.

## Reproducing the Error (In the `bug.js` file)

To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:
1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Run `expo prebuild`.
3.  Observe the error output (simulated within the `bug.js` file).
