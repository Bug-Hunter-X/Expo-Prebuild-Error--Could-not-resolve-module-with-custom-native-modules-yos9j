The solution usually involves meticulously checking your native module setup and dependencies.  Here's a breakdown of common fixes:

1. **Verify Native Module Installation and Configuration:** Double-check that your native module is correctly installed and configured according to its documentation. Pay close attention to any platform-specific requirements (iOS, Android).

2. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** Use a tool like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect your dependency tree and identify potential version conflicts. Resolving conflicts might involve updating or downgrading packages to find a compatible set of versions.

3. **Check for Correct Paths:** Confirm that the paths to your native module within your project and within the Expo build process are accurate. Any discrepancies can cause resolution failures.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean rebuild resolves issues. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. After this, run `expo prebuild` again.

5. **Enable Detailed Logging:**  Increase the verbosity of your build logs to get more detailed error messages. This can help you pinpoint the exact location of the problem. Expo has options to configure logging verbosity.

6. **Simplify:** Temporarily remove any unnecessary native modules or dependencies to isolate the problem. This can help you determine if the conflict involves a specific native module.

Example of Improved Module Setup (Illustrative):

```javascript
// ... (Your existing code)

// Ensure correct linking and configuration within your native module's build process.

//Example of a better config file 
// this is only for illustration purposes 
// check the documentation of the native module you are using

//android/app/build.gradle
android {
  defaultConfig {
    ... 
    ndk {
        abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86', 'arm64-v8a' // or the correct ABI
    }
  }
}

//Check the package.json to ensure the modules are correctly listed and version are compatable

// ... (Rest of your code)
```

By systematically addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the "Could not resolve module" error during Expo's prebuild process.
